  The model is stored in a python dictionary where each variable name is the key and the corresponding value is a tensor containing 
that variable's value. To run an image through this network, you just have to feed the image to the model. In TensorFlow, you can 
do so using the tf.assign function. In particular, you will use the assign function like this:
  model["input"].assign(image)
  This assigns the image as an input to the model. After this, if you want to access the activations of a particular layer, say 
layer 4_2 when the network is run on this image, you would run a TensorFlow session on the correct tensor conv4_2, as follows:
  sess.run(model["conv4_2"])
  模型存储在一个python字典中。只需要将图片喂给模型就可以通过模型中运行该图片。分派图片作为模型输入。然后，如果想要访问特定一层的激活值，例如当网络运行在
  图片时的4_2层，可以使用：
    sess.run(model["conv4_2"])
